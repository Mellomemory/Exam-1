This Screenshot shows the code necassary for the applkication to run, the names behind the ID are up to personal preference but I chose what was easiest for me to type while being as clear as possible in case someone other than myself had to work on the application.
This also shows the code necessary for the user to look up songs and add them to a plalist as well as rate or comment on the songs.

I tried to maintain a clear screen where buttons were placed in places people would expect them as it makes the user expierience better.

The code here is necassary for the detailed view to run and for the back and forth switching between it and the Main screen, without it, it would not be possible to switch back to the main screen nor would the average work nor the detailed view of the playlist.

Like the main screen, it shows how the screen is streamlined in a way to make it easier on the user as the buttons and table is placed in areas that the user would be familiar with.
